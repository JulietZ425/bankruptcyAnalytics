# Bankruptcy Analytics
This project is to analyze a bankruptcy data from Kaggle (www.kaggle.com). In this data mining course project, I was able to apply the data mining algorithms covered in the course and apply them in real data competition.

## Code
The relevant code is in the datamining project jupyter python file. It include the data pipline, model selection, model tunning with grid research.
